# DÃ©verser
Simple macOS script to dump onboard SHSH for iOS devices

## Requirements

A macOS machine
A jailbroken device with OpenSSH installed (Specific jailbreak doesn't matter, E.G checkra1n, Unc0ver, chimera, etc)
img4tool installed (If img4tool is not installed, the script will download the latest release from Tihmstar's repo and install it after getting the users permission)

## Usage

1. Either run 'git clone https://github.com/MatthewPierson/deverser.git' or [download the .zip from here](https://github.com/MatthewPierson/deverser/archive/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your machine
2. 'cd' to the deverser folder and then run 'chmod +x deverser.sh'
3. Run './deverser.sh'
4. Follow what the script asks you to do (Mostly just entering your device's IP address and root password for SSH/SCP)
